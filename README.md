# PROJECT NAME

## About the Game
A first-person narrative game where you are on a train and are approached by tea making strangers, telling you tales about their favourite teas, their experiences and stories as they make tea for you. 
  
As the stories begin from each stranger, the scenery around you changes, transporting you to their experiences and tea making lessons in a dreamlike world.
